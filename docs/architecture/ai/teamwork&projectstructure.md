# Projectmanagement
We managed our workflow using GitHub Projects combined with a weekly Jour Fixe. This setup worked very well and kept the team aligned throughout the project. Adam took on the role of Project Manager (PM); he led the weekly meetings, organized the ticket backlog, and ensured the project stayed on track.

# Teamwork Evaluation

### What Went Well

- **Independent Work:** Team members worked reliably and independently on their assigned tasks.
    
- **Weekly Jour Fixe:** Our weekly meetings were highly effective for discussing current progress, resolving blockers, and planning next steps.
    
- **GitHub Projects:** Using GitHub for project management provided clear transparency over task statuses and overall progress.
    
- **Code Reviews:** Regular code reviews helped us maintain code quality and catch issues early in the development process.
    
- **Communication:** General, day-to-day communication within the team was open and constructive.
    

### What Could Be Improved

- **Productivity Drop:** Project velocity noticeably slowed down during the university exam phase, which impacted our timeline.
    
- **Uneven Workloads:** There were differences in the amount of time and effort contributed by different group members.
    
- **Communication Bottlenecks:** While everyday communication was good, explaining and discussing highly complex technical topics was sometimes difficult.
    
- **Knowledge Silos:** It was often challenging to fully understand the specific components built by other team members.
    

### Key Learnings

- **Realistic Estimates:** In the future, we need to estimate task durations and our personal capacities more realistically to avoid project bottlenecks.
    
- **GenAPI in DevOps:** We gained valuable, practical experience integrating Generative AI APIs into our DevOps workflows.
    
- **Active Knowledge Exchange:** To prevent knowledge silos, we need to actively share information across the team. Practices like Pair Programming would be a great way to improve mutual understanding of the code.
    
- **Continuous Documentation:** We learned that keeping a knowledge base and documentation updated continuously—rather than writing it all at the end—is essential for team alignment and maintaining the project.
