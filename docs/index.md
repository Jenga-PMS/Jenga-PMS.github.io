## Why

### Jenga
Jenga is a lightweight, easy-to-use alternative to heavy project tools. It was created to provide a open source issue tracking tool for everyone, while also featuring a integrated AI-Agent to help you automate repetitive tasks.

### Free & Open Source
We have made this project free & open source so other people can benefit from it, whether for practical use or as an educational software development reference, while enabling the development of a transparent and community-driven tool. The [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) was selected to allow Jenga to be freely adapted and integrated into any project without the burden of restrictive legal requirements.
