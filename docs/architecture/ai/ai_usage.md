Throughout the development of this project, AI tools were utilized to support my workflow. Great care was taken to ensure AI acted as an assistant rather than a replacement for original work:

- **Assisted Coding:** AI was used to help with debugging, performing bulk operations, and exploring technical approaches, rather than blindly copy-pasting code.
- **Text Formatting & Polishing:** All core documentation and text were written manually first. AI was strictly used for non-substantive edits. to refine, format, and "prettify" the final phrasing.
- **Knowledge Acquisition:** AI was utilized primarily as an advanced research tool, similar to a traditional search engine.
