# Jenga AI Agent

The Jenga AI Agent is a powerful, integrated assistant designed to act as a "co-pilot" for your project management tasks. It is built directly into the Jenga backend using the **Quarkus Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**, which gives it real-time access to your project data.

This document outlines the agent's internal architecture, its available tools, and its core safety principles.
